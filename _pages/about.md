About me
==
I am currently a graduate student majoring in Statistics in the [Department of Statistical Science, University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/mathematical-physical-sciences/statistics). Previously I was graduated frpm the [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/), where I earned my First Class Honours Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Distincition Master's degree in Statistics.

Research
==
My research on statistics focus on the fields of computational statistics, involving the analysis and evaluation on stochastic simulation and Monte Carlo methods. In my final undergraduate year I have completed a project related to the sampling from log-concave distributions through Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, supervised by [Dr. Deniz Akyildiz](https://akyildiz.me/). Meanwhile, I am currently working with [Dr. Samuel Livingstone](https://samueljlivingstone.wixsite.com/webpage) focusing on the mixing time on MCMC methods.

Additionally, I aim to deepen my expertise in [time series analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series). This field, when integrated with Markov chains, is invaluable for analyzing and predicting trends in various natural phenomena and developing models in financial sectors. In my Master's thesis (supervised by Professor [Guy P. Nason](https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/g.nason/about)) I have worked on the network GARCH time series model to investigate the high dimensional, network volatility spillovers over financial assets, involving the derivation of a novel model, with its vectorisation and conversion, stationarity conditions, and also an extension by incorporating threshold coefficients to capture leverage effects.

My Goals
==
My goal is to leverage my statistical knowledge to make meaningful contributions in areas such as time series analysis, statistical learning and computation statistics.

Get in Touch
==
I am always eager to connect with anyone with a shared interest in the fields of statistics, data science and machine learning. Whether it's for collaboration, discussion, or simply sharing knowledge, I would always welcome the opportunity to engage with you.


Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you!
