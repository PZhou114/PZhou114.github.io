'Be conscious, be conscientious.'

About me
==
Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! 

I am currently a final year undergraduate student majoring in Mathematics, and about to be a postgraduate student in [Statistics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics/) (Applied Statistics) in the [Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/).

Research
==
My research on statistics focus on the fields of [computational statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics), involving the analysis and evaluation on [stochastic simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_simulation) and [Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). Currently I'm working on a project related to the sampling from log-concave distributions through
Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, supervised by [Dr. Deniz Akyildiz](https://akyildiz.me/).

Additionally, I aim to deepen my expertise in [time series analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series). This field, when integrated with Markov chains, is invaluable for analyzing and predicting trends in various natural phenomena and developing models in financial sectors. Coupled with AI, data science, and machine learning, these tasks can be performed more efficiently, offering significant benefits.

My Goals
==
My goal is to leverage my statistical knowledge to make meaningful contributions in areas such as data science, machine learning, time series analysis and computation statistics.

Get in Touch
==
I am always eager to connect with anyone with a shared interest in the fields of statistics, data science and machine learning. Whether it's for collaboration, discussion, or simply sharing knowledge, I would always welcome the opportunity to engage with you.


Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you!
