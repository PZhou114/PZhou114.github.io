'Be conscious, be conscientious.'

About me
==
Hello and welcome to my corner of the internet! 

I am currently a final year graduate student majoring in [Statistics](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/statistics/) (Applied Statistics) in the [Department of Mathematics, Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/mathematics/), where I also earned a First Class Honours Bachelor's degree in Mathematics.

Research
==
My research on statistics focus on the fields of [computational statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_statistics), involving the analysis and evaluation on [stochastic simulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_simulation) and [Monte Carlo methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method). In my final undergraduate year I have completed a project related to the sampling from log-concave distributions through Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, supervised by [Dr. Deniz Akyildiz](https://akyildiz.me/).

Additionally, I aim to deepen my expertise in [time series analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series). This field, when integrated with Markov chains, is invaluable for analyzing and predicting trends in various natural phenomena and developing models in financial sectors. Currently I am working on the volatility clustering, ARCH, GARCH and also network time series models, delving into their statistical properties and practical applications.

My Goals
==
My goal is to leverage my statistical knowledge to make meaningful contributions in areas such as time series analysis, statistical learning and computation statistics.

Get in Touch
==
I am always eager to connect with anyone with a shared interest in the fields of statistics, data science and machine learning. Whether it's for collaboration, discussion, or simply sharing knowledge, I would always welcome the opportunity to engage with you.


Thank you for visiting my page, and I look forward to connecting with you!
