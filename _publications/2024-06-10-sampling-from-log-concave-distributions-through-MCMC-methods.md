excerpt: 'This report has been uploaded and made available within Imperial College London, but it has not been published in any journals or on websites such as arXiv. 
This report aims to discuss the behaviour of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for dealing with sampling problems, involving (i) the implementation of unadjusted Langevin algorithm derived from overdamped Langevin stochastic differential equation, and (ii) underdamped Langevin samplers derived from underdamped Langevin stochastic differential equation, with two different discretisations. For visualisation and evaluation of each algorithm’s sampling performance, we focus on analysing the behaviour for sampling from the 1D Gaussian distributions, as an example of a log-concave distribution, which will be used as the target distribution throughout this report. Particularly, we will derive analytic expressions for the stationary distributions of these discretisations, some of which are known in the literature whereas some are not. Of particular importance are the stationary distributions of underdamped Langevin algorithms, which are not given as examples in the literature before, which we find important to derive. We will also discuss the convergence properties of these algorithms.'

This report aims to discuss the behaviour of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods for dealing with sampling problems, involving (i) the implementation of unadjusted Langevin algorithm derived from overdamped Langevin stochastic differential equation, and (ii) underdamped Langevin samplers derived from underdamped Langevin stochastic differential equation, with two different discretisations. For visualisation and evaluation of each algorithm’s sampling performance, we focus on analysing the behaviour for sampling from the 1D Gaussian distributions, as an example of a log-concave distribution, which will be used as the target distribution throughout this report. Particularly, we will derive analytic expressions for the stationary distributions of these discretisations, some of which are known in the literature whereas some are not. Of particular importance are the stationary distributions of underdamped Langevin algorithms, which are not given as examples in the literature before, which we find important to derive. We will also discuss the convergence properties of these algorithms.
